# Transformers-eComm-EQA

RESEARCH PROJECT: Unleashing the Power of Transformers: Extractive Question Answering for E-Commerce Platforms using Product Description and Features

## Requirements

+ PyTorch
+ Transformers
+ Wandb and Hugging face account
+ Download any metadata from Amazon Review Dataset 2018 if you want to test the dataset preparation scripts [Amazon Review Data 2018](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/)

## Steps to Run

TRAINING: Extract the "Cell phones and Accesories" stored in each trainsfomers folder, then run the train pynb script to fine-tune the models.(CUSTOM DATASET: [Cell_Phones_and_Accessories_final.zip])

TESTING: If you want to use the model we created then directly run the scripts. If you fine-tuned your model then do upload your model in Hugging face and replace hugging face login, tokenizer and model with your model.
